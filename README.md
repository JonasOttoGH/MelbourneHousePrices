Act: Summary of the insights gained from Tableau Visualization
- Although house prices dipped quite significantly during July, they have overall gradually increased over time throughout 2016.
- There is a correlation between house prices in Melbourne and there distance from the CBD. Except for the few outliers, the houses within 10km from CBD had an average of around $1.1 million while house prices 15km or further away from the CDB had an average of below $1 million.
- Houses where much more common to sell over unit/duplexes, and apartments being at lowest with only 3000 sold on the market.
